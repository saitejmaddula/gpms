Gate pass management system
The Gate Pass Management process was computerized to have an easy mechanism for resident students to apply for a Gate Pass in the campus. 
The Gate Pass system is to ensure that the information on students’ exit from and entry to the campus is maintained. 
The computerized Gate Pass Management System (GPMS) system was introduced to overcome the limitations of the manual system that had its limitations with regard to application process, approval system, etc.


The GPMS system allows a resident student to apply for her / his Gate Pass online. The concerned hostel authorities approve this request and student can login to her/his account and check the approval status of her/his gate pass. The student just needs to enter her/his gate pass id to    indicate a valid exit. GPMS mainly focuses on operations like adding users, requesting gate pass and    approving gate pass. Each user is provided an account to carry out their respective permitted tasks.


There are four types of users who can interact with the GPMS :
i)Admin-who can add users to the database.
ii)Warden-who has authority to approve gate pass.
iii)Student-who can request and view all his/her gate passes and  their approval status.
iv)Security-who checks the approval status of gate pass.
